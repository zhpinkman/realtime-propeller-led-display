# RealTime Propeller Led Display

This is an online propeller display we built for our Real-Time Embedded Systems course project.

- It can stream videos from an android phone continuously, 
- show what is being painted on the device in real-time, 
- and show any picture from the gallery.


We used C++ on ESP32 microcontroller, Java on Android, and UDP protocol to connect them together.
